**Communication Made Easy** - Just press and talk to your coworkers.

Hi there! This app is developed by George, Peter(me), Kush, and Nathan as a UNC COMP523 course project with a client, David Berkoff.
This is a ‘walkie talkie’ type app for medical clinic staff that will allow you to create work groups that you can communicate with from any location in the clinic. The voice messages will be transmitted to all members of the group immediately, along with being transcribed and stored for a short period of time on HIPAA safe servers. 

If you want to see the project details, check out our website ([@website](https://tarheels.live/comp523grouph/)).
