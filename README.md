**Communication Made Easy** - Just press and talk to your coworkers.

Hi there! This app is developed by George, Peter(me), Kush, and Nathan as a UNC COMP523 course project with a client, David Berkoff.
This is a ‘walkie talkie’ type app for medical clinic staff that will allow you to create work groups that you can communicate with from any location in the clinic. The voice messages will be transmitted to all members of the group immediately, along with being transcribed and stored for a short period of time on HIPAA safe servers. 

If you want to see the project details, check out our website ([@website](https://tarheels.live/comp523grouph/)).

## Getting Started
Prerequisites: Before developing or running this software, you have to be running MacOS and have Xcode downloaded.

Installing: 

- Open Xcode
- Clone the repository from Github onto your computer.
- Done
- Running locally: In order to run the app locally, you can build the app for the iPhone. Once the build has succeeded, click the play button in the top left corner of the Xcode window and it should create an emulator of the device selected at the top and present the app as if it was installed on the device.
- In order to push any new changes onto the github repo, you must give Xcode the access to your Github account by going to Xcode -> Preferences -> Accounts tab and then adding your Github account with your Github token.

## Technologies Used
We are making use of the Xcode IDE, coding entirely in Swift, Firebase iOS SDK, and Firebase products such as Firebase Auth, Firestore and Storage.
